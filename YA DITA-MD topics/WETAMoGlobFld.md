To delete a global field, see task "**Deleting metadata**". A link to this topic is under **Related tasks** below.

1.  Ensure you are logged into the SAFR Workbench as a **system or environment administrator** in the relevant environment.

4.  Modify values in the fields. For screen help press F1. Above **Related Topics** click ![](images/Icon_Maximize_01.GIF) to maximize the help and select topic "**Edit Global Field screen help**". To close the help, click X inside the "**Help**" tab.

5.  When all fields are complete,

    -   **EITHER** click ![](images/Icon_Save_03.GIF) \(the save icon\),
