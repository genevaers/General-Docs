# Overview of SAFR terms used in PE {#SACOvTerms .concept}

## Table of SAFR Terms { .section}

|Term|Notes|Overview under "Related concepts"|
|----|-----|---------------------------------|
|Compile phase|The compile phase is the part of PE that receives a VDP XML file and outputs a VDP dataset. This process recompiles the views involved, and ensures that the latest compiler is used.|Compile phase overview|
|Event file|An event file is a file of transactions such as a sales file.|Event and Reference files overview|
|EXT file|An EXT file is a Extract Work File, that is created in the extract phase and passed to the format phase.|EXT file overview|
|Extract file|An extract file is an output file from the extract phase in PE.|Extract phase overview|
|Extract phase|The extract phase is the part of PE that extracts data from input \(source\) files and creates data fields for output. There is always an extract phase when running PE.|Extract phase overview|
|Format phase|The format phase is the part of PE that formats data in an output file. There is always a format phase for a hardcopy report. A format phase is otherwise optional.|Format phase overview|
|JLT file|The letters stand for Join Logic Table. This is sometimes called a Reference Logic Table, because this table is used in the reference phase and prepares a lot of data for lookups that use reference files.|JLT file overview|
|Logic phase|The logic phase prepares the logic table files used in later parts of PE.|Logic phase overview|
|Logic table|A logic table is a set of instructions the either execute lookup paths or the extract phase.|Logic tables and codes overview|
|Logic table code|A logic table code is a function code that describes one instruction in a logic table.|Logic tables and codes overview|
|Logic text|Logic text is optional text added to a view that changes how the results of the view.|Logic text overview|
|RED file|RED file = Reference Detail file. A RED file is a file generated by SAFR to ensure fast processing for a step in a lookup path.|RED file overview|
|Reference file|A reference file is a file of information about some entity such a product or customer. Each entity has a unique key, for example, a Product ID or Customer ID.|Event and Reference files overview|
|Reference phase|The reference phase prepares reference files for processing in the extract phase of PE.|Reference phase overview|
|REH file|REH file = Reference Header file. An REH file is a file generated by SAFR to identify the RED file relevant for each step in each lookup path in the extract phase.|REH file overview|
|RTH file|RTH file = Reference formaT Header file. An RTH file is a file generated by SAFR to identify the RED file relevant for each step in each lookup path in the format phase.|RTH file overview|
|Select phase|The select phase identifies one or more views for processing in that PE batch flow.|Select phase overview|
|SXT file|SXT = Sort eXTract file. To be completed.

|SXT file overview|
|VDP file|VDP = View Definition Parameters. The VDP is a mainframe dataset that drives PE to produce the results for views you select.|VDP file overview|
|Views|A view is a description of the output required from a run of PE.|Views overview|
|XLT file|The letters stand for eXtract Logic Table. An XLT file is used to drive the extract phase of PE.|XLT file overview|
|zIIP|The letters stand for \(System\) z Integrated Information Processor. This is a special purpose hardware processor that relieves the CPU of high DB2 workloads.|zIIP overview|
