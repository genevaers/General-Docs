# Why use SAFR? {#SARFaq5WhySAFR .reference}

There is a primary and a secondary reason to use SAFR.

## Primary reason: financial reporting { .section}

The primary reason to use SAFR is because financial reporting systems often give summary results without the details behind them. If you question a figure in the financial summary, finding the detail can be a slow and costly exercise of manual searching. SAFR provides all the same financial summaries and makes the detail behind the results easy to access, because a SAFR solution does not "throw away" the details like a traditional financial system does.

SAFR also provides financial reporting faster than traditional financial systems. For example, updating financial details for a past time period can be difficult and expensive. With the SAFR approach, updating financial details for a past time period can be quick and can be done anytime. SAFR can take away the need to "close off" accounts for a period.

SAFR also provides the capability to integrate your financial reporting with the rest of your IT systems. Instead of "finance" being a separate system that contains only financial information, the financial reports are prepared from your existing systems, which preserves the accuracy and control held in those systems.

## Secondary reason: speed problems { .section}

SAFR fixes speed problems such as the following:

-   Your company has **too much processing for the overnight mainframe batch window**. The existing jobs take too long and there are more batch jobs that need to be run.
-   Your company has a data warehouse but there is **not enough processing time to report on the data.** The company may wish to analyze trends or discover important relationships between different data, but the reporting takes too long to be ready in a timely fashion.
-   **SQL access to relational data takes too long** to produce results. Your company has the correct data in tables, but SQL queries are too slow to be useful.

These are the situations where SAFR can provide faster processing and reporting than traditional mainframe or SQL based applications.
