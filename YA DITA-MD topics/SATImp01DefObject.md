# Stage 1: Define objectives {#SATImp01DefObject .task}

This tasks assumes you have purchased and installed SAFR.

For details of the install, see topic "**SAFR Install**". A link to that overview is under **Related reference** below.

This task requires detailed knowledge of the IT systems in your company. You must be familiar with the entire IT systems, or the specific IT systems relevant to SAFR.

You must also be familiar with the problems that the SAFR product can solve. See these topics:

-   "**Example: Overnight batch takes too long**"
-   "**Example: Reports take too long**"
-   "**Example: SQL Query takes too long**"
-   "**Example: Analyzing accounting figures takes too long**"
-   "**Example: Changing past accounting figures takes too long**"

Links to the above topics are under **Related reference** below.

1.  Choose the SAFR solutions that are relevant to your company. As a guide, read the example topics under "**About this task**" above.

    For example, the overnight batch processing may be taking too long and requires the same processing is done hours earlier.

2.  Identify the parts of your IT systems that require the solutions chosen in the previous step.

    For example, the financial reports and updated files may be the focus of the implementation of SAFR.

3.  Estimate the savings possible from using SAFR.

    The potential savings may be known due to a "Proof of Concept" study completed by IBM for your company.

4.  Document the results so that these details are available for later stages.

    The documented results of this stage cover:

    -   The problems identified and the target SAFR solutions.
    -   The relevant parts of the IT systems in your company.
    -   The savings that are the goal of the implementation of SAFR.

See task "**Stage 2: Analyze existing systems**". A link to that overview is under **Related tasks** below.
