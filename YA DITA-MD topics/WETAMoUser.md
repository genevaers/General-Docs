# Modifying users {#WETAMoUser .task}

Ensure you know the following:

-   The **name** of the user.

Use this topic to modify users. Only system administrators can perform this task.

Note that the rights for a general user come from a group the user chooses during login to SAFR.

To change the groups the user is a member of, use topic "**Modifying group membership**". To change the permissions in the group, see topics "**Modifying group permissions by group**" and "**Modifying group permissions by environment**". Links to these topics are under **Related tasks** below.

To delete a user, see task "**Deleting metadata**". A link to this topic is under **Related tasks** below.

1.  Ensure you are logged into the SAFR Workbench as a **system administrator** in any environment. To modify the system administrator account itself, select **File -\> Update User Profile** and go to step 4.

2.  In the Navigator, open **Administration** and click **Users**.

    If the Navigator is not visible, click **Window -\> Show -\> Navigator**.

3.  In the Metadata List, double click on the user that needs update. If the list is long, you can search the list. This is done by clicking in the Metadata List table and pressing F3. For more about this searching, read task "**Searching lists of metadata**".

4.  Enter or modify values in the fields. For screen help press F1. Above **Related Topics** click ![](images/Icon_Maximize_01.GIF) to maximize the help and select topic "**Edit User screen help**". To close the help, click X inside the "**Help**" tab.

5.  If a default environment, default group or default view folder is assigned and is no longer required, then click the **Refresh defaults** button ![](images/Icon_Refresh_03.GIF) at right, or press Alt+F6.

6.  When all fields are complete,

    -   **EITHER** click ![](images/Icon_Save_03.GIF) \(the save icon\),
    -   **OR** select **File, Save**,
    -   **OR** press **Ctrl+S**.
    For errors or messages on this screen, see topic "**Edit User errors**". For a link, see under **Related reference** below.


After the above is complete, the user may not be ready for immediate use. Make the user a member of their default group or at least one group using topic "**Modifying group membership**". To change the permissions in the group, see topics "**Modifying group permissions by group**" and "**Modifying group permissions by environment**".
