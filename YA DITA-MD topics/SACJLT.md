## 10 What is a JLT file? {#10 .section}

JLT = **Join Logic Table**.

This is sometimes called a **Reference Logic Table**, because this table is used in the reference phase and prepares a lot of data for lookups that use reference files. All logic tables are mainframe files, hence the expression "JLT file".

A JLT file is used to prepare files to implement lookup paths in PE. If the views selected have no lookup paths, then the JLT file is empty.

The JLT file is **empty** when any of the following is true:

-   There are **no** lookup paths in the views selected.
-   One or more **user-exit routines** perform all lookups in the views selected.

To implement look paths, the JLT file contains view numbers that are completely different to the view numbers selected in the select phase. The view numbers contained in the JLT are views generated by SAFR for the purpose of enabling the lookups in views you select. The generated view numbers are created by MR90. MR95 reads these views in the JLT and executes the instructions in order to create the appropriate RED file\(s\), the REH file and the RTH file. The details of how lookup paths are implemented are best covered in topic "**RED file overview**".

## 30 How is a JLT file created? {#30 .section}

A JLT file is created in program **MR90** in the **logic** phase. The JLT includes commands for any lookup paths in the view\(s\) selected for this run of PE. If the view\(s\) contain no lookup paths, then the JLT is empty.

## 40 Processing for JLT files {#40 .section}

![](images/JLT_Phases_01.gif)

Processing of JLT files is as follows:

1.  The **JLT** is created in program **MR90** in the **logic** phase. The JLT includes commands for any lookup paths in the view\(s\) selected for this run of PE. If the view\(s\) contain no lookup paths, then the JLT is empty.

    For more, see these topics:

    -   "**Logic phase overview**"
    -   "**MR90 Logic Table Generator overview**"
    Links to these overviews are under **Related concepts** below.

2.  The **JLT** is converted into EBCDIC format in program **MR76** in the **logic** phase. This conversion covers the commands for lookup paths that are stored in the JLT.

    For more, see these topics:

    -   "**Logic phase overview**"
    -   "**MR76 LT to EBCDIC overview**"
    Links to these overviews are under **Related concepts** below.

3.  A report on the **JLT** is created by program **UT90** in the **reference** phase. This report shows the lookup paths contained in the JLT.

    For more, see these topics:

    -   "**Reference phase overview**"
    -   "**UT90 Logic Table Report overview**"
    Links to these overviews are under **Related concepts** below.

4.  Program **MR95** uses the **JLT** file to create the **Reference Detail \(RED\)** and **Reference Header \(REH\)** and **Reference formaT Header \(RTH\)** files in the **reference** phase.

    For more, see these topics:

    -   "**Reference phase overview**"

    -   "**REH file overview**"
    -   "**RTH file overview**"
