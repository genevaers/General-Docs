    -   **OR** click **Administration -\> New -\> User**.

4.  When all fields are complete,

    -   **EITHER** click ![](images/Icon_Save_03.GIF) \(the save icon\),

After the above is complete, the user is NOT ready for immediate use. Immediately afterwards, make the user a member of their default group or at least one group using topic "**Modifying group membership**". To change the permissions in the group, see topics "**Modifying group permissions by group**" and "**Modifying group permissions by environment**". Links to these topics are under **Related tasks** below.
