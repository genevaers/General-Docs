## 10 Three types of user for the SAFR Workbench {#10 .section}

![](images/User_Concept_Admin_GU_02.gif)

The SAFR Workbench has these users:

-   **General users** who focus on producing results for your company using SAFR.

    A general user specifies an environment and a group at login time. The group provides the access authorities.

-   **Environment administrators** who focus on preparing an environment for work by general users.

    An environment administrators specifies an environment and a group at login time. The group provides the access authorities.

-   **System administrators** who focus on preparing all environments for work by environment administrators and general users.

    A system administrator specifies an environment only at login time \(and does not specify a group\). A system administrator is not affected by group membership themselves. A system administrator decides group membership for all other users, which effectively decides access authorities for all general users and environment administrators.


For more on the access authorities mentioned above, see topics "**Groups overview**" , "**Groups - advanced overview**" and "**WE Security overview**". Links to these overviews are under **Related concepts** below.

## 90 The SAFR User ID and your mainframe systems {#90 .section}

A SAFR User ID gives you access to the SAFR Workbench. You login to the SAFR Workbench using this User ID.

For the SAFR User ID to work you must **already have a mainframe User ID** to access the mainframe computer systems in your company.

The SAFR User ID does not have to be the same as your mainframe User ID. What is important is that you have both.
