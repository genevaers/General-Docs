# Finding screen help {#WETZFindHelp .task}

This topic shows you how to find help for any screen in the SAFR Workbench. This applies to all users of the SAFR Workbench.

This topic assumes you are on a screen in the SAFR Workbench, and you require help with either of the following:

-   **Screen help**- actions required on a screen and details of each field on that screen.
-   **Errors** - all messages and a solution for each.

1.  For **screen help** \(covering actions and fields on a screen\), do the following on any screen:

    1.  **Click F1**

    2.  Above **Related Topics** click ![](images/Icon_Maximize_01.GIF) to maximize the help

    3.  Click a **screen help** link and view the help.

    4.  Click X inside the "**Help**" tab to close the help screen.

    An alternative method to find this help is to click ![](images/Icon_Help_02.GIF) or click **Help -\> Help Content** or **Click F2**. On the screen that appears, click **Screens** and choose a screen topic.

    This alternative method opens a new full screen window just for help. To close this window, click ![](images/Icon_Close_Workbench_01.gif) in the top right hand corner.
