# What does the WE stand for? {#WERFaqCWE .reference}

**WE** stands for **Workbench Eclipse.**

**Eclipse** refers to a programming platform that was invented by IBM and is now free and open source software.

In 2010, IBM upgraded the original SAFR **Windows Workbench \(WW\)** software to use Eclipse, and added greater functionality.

The Workbench is software that you use to configure SAFR in order to do work. For more on this, see topic "**Workbench Overview**". A link to this topic is under **Related concepts** below.
