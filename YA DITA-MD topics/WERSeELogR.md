## 02 Display of messages {#02 .section}

If there are **errors**:

-   A window "**Error saving Logical Record**" lists all the errors, and the logical record is not saved. No warning messages are shown. Warnings are only shown if there are no errors.
-   A large error icon ![](images/Icon_Error_Large_01.gif) appears to the left of "Edit Logical Record".
-   **Hover** over "**N errors detected**" to see all errors in the entire logical record.
-   If present, **hover** over the small error icon ![](images/Icon_Error_Field_01.gif) to see all errors in that field.

If there are **warnings**:

-   A window "**Validations**" lists all the warnings. This means there are no errors, only warning messages.
-   An large warning icon ![](images/Icon_Warning_Large_01.gif) appears to the left of "Edit Logical Record".
-   **Hover** over "**N warnings detected**" to see all warnings in the entire logical record.
-   If present, **hover** over the small warning icon ![](images/Icon_Warning_Field_01.gif) to see all warnings in that field.

If there are issues with **dependencies** then these windows may appear:

-   **Field dependencies** - if particular fields in the logical record are used in lookup paths and views.Â This window **cancels the save** \(there is no choice\).
-   **Logical Record dependencies** - if this logical record is used in lookup paths or views. This window allows a **choice to proceed or cancel the save**.
-   **Logical Record/Logical File dependencies** - if the logical file to be dissociated is used in lookup paths or views. This window **cancels the save** \(there is no choice\).

|-------|--------|
|The selected field cannot be deleted because it is used in a Lookup Path or View. You must first remove this dependency.|The SAFR Workbench does not make the changes you requested because of these dependencies.|
|The selected field\(s\) cannot be deleted because the field\(s\) mentioned below are used in a Lookup Path\(s\) or View\(s\). You must first remove this dependency.|The SAFR Workbench does not make the changes you requested because of these dependencies.|
|The below fields cannot be deleted because they are used in a Lookup Path or View, and hence have been restored. Please review the LR Fields and save again.|The SAFR Workbench does not make the changes you requested because of these dependencies. This message occurs when another user has created a dependency in the few moments before you clicked Save.|
