## Scalable Architecture for Financial Reporting { .section}

SAFR is pronounced "SAF-fer". Rhymes with "matter".

**Scalable** means that the existing architecture can accommodate a huge growth in business and requirements. To illustrate the idea of scalable, consider an analogy.

A household kitchen is useful for cooking meals for one to about ten people. At a stretch, the kitchen can be used for 20 with a lot of help and larger utensils. However, to cook for 20,000 people a household kitchen is not appropriate, and an entirely different kitchen is needed, even if the same ingredients are used to prepare the same dishes. In this analogy, a household kitchen is NOT scalable - the kitchen does not work well if the business expands by 1,000 times or so.

Scalable means you can use the same equipment when your business or reporting expands. **SAFR is still appropriate if your business or reporting requirements expand as much as 1,000 times**. In fact, SAFR is likely to be even more appropriate after such an increase.
