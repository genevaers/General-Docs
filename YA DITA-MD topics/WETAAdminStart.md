# Administrators START HERE {#WETAAdminStart .task}

The following topics are general background for a system administrator or environment administrator:

-   All overview topics - for example, "**Metadata overview**" and "**WE Security overview**".
-   "**Basics of using the SAFR Workbench**",
-   "**Logging into the SAFR Workbench**",
-   "**Return to login**",
-   "**Finding screen help**",
-   "**What are the keyboard shortcuts?**"

Ensure you know the following:

-   The goals of using SAFR in your company.
-   The **mainframe systems** in your company appropriate for using SAFR. These suggest environments you need in the SAFR Workbench. For example, this might be your accounting systems, sales systems, and market research. These areas may be broken down more, into types of accounting, sales groups and markets for different products.
-   The **mainframe datasets and DB2 tables** relevant for SAFR processing.
-   Any **user-exit routines** used by your company. For example, some data might be encrypted, or some keys may be generated from other information.
-   The**mainframe users** who need access to SAFR.
