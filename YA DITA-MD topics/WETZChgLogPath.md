# Changing Log Path {#WETZChgLogPath .task}

This topic is about changing the path for the WE log file or viewing the current path. Each user of WE can nominate a unique log file path. When the log file path changes, the existing log is transferred to the new path and no log file data is lost for that session. Log files for completed sessions are untouched by this process.

For an introduction to a WE log file, see topic "**WE log file overview**". A link to that topic is under **Related concepts** below.

1.  Ensure you are logged into the Workbench in any environment.

2.  Click **File -\> Change Log Path...**.

3.  View the current path for the log file. If viewing is sufficient, click Cancel. To change the path, either navigate to a different existing folder or create a new folder.

    To find screen help on all the ways to create a new folder, click ![](images/Icon_Help_02.GIF). On the screen that appears, click **Screens** and choose topic "**Change Log Path screen help**".

    An alternative method to find screen help is to click **Help -\> Help Content**. On the screen that appears, click **Screens** and choose topic "**Change Log Path screen help**".

4.  When the required folder for the log file path is highlighted, click OK to save.


If the log file path is changed, the new log file path is immediately in use. The log data for the current session is available in the new path and contains data for the entire session.

To open a log file, see topic "**Opening a log file**". A link to that task is under **Related tasks** below.
