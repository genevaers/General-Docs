# Modifying environments {#WETAMoEnv .task}

Ensure you know the following:

-   The name of the **environment** that needs update.
-   A possible **new name** for the environment.
-   A possible **comment** to make.
-   Any requirements to **enable or disable archiving** in the new environment.

Use this topic to modify the environment record itself \(but not any metadata inside the environment\). Only system and environment administrators can perform this task.

An entire environment cannot be copied in a single operation. The metadata inside an environment can be copied to another environment using task "**Migrating metadata between environments**". A link to this task is under **Related tasks** below.

To copy metadata inside an environment, see task "**Copying metadata**". A link to this task is under **Related tasks** below.

To clear all the metadata inside an environment, see task "**Clear environment**". A link to this task is under **Related tasks** below.

To delete an environment record itself, see task "**Deleting metadata**". A link to this topic is under **Related tasks** below.
