# Searching lists of metadata {#WETZSearchMList .task}

All users of the SAFR workbench can perform this task.

1.  This topic assumes you are on a screen in the SAFR Workbench that has a list of metadata items. **Click in that list of metadata.**

2.  Start the search as follows:

    -   **EITHER** press **F3**. Nothing happens if searching is not available in the context.
    -   **OR** click on the **search icon** ![](images/Icon_SearchMetadata_01.gif) in any location this search icon can be found. There is always a search icon on the Workbench toolbar, and some dialog boxes contain a search icon for easy access. This icon is grey if searching is not available in the context.
    -   **OR** select **File, Search**. This menu item is grey if searching is not available in the context.
3.  In the screen "**Search Metadata Component**", do the following:

    1.  Choose the type of search you require: either "**By ID**" or "**By Name**".

    2.  In the field "**Search text**" type either the ID or the first characters in the metadata component name.

    3.  Click OK to start the search.

4.  If the component is found, then you are returned to the metadata list with that component highlighted.
