# Empty "Deleted Views" folder {#WETAEmptyDelView .task}

Ensure you know the following:

-   You have **checked the folder "Deleted Views"** in the relevant environment and confirmed that all views can be deleted permanently.

This task describes how to delete all views in the folder "**Deleted Views**". See also topic "**Deleting metadata**".

Before delete of view, you may consider taking a backup - see task "**Exporting metadata**". A link to this topic is under **Related tasks** below.

Instead of emptying the entire folder, you can click on the "**Deleted Views**" folder in the Navigator, and highlight each view and click ![](images/Icon_Del_Metadata_01.gif).Â That method allows deleting only selected views in that folder. This topic is about deleting all views in that folder.

This task is for system and environment administrators only.

For an introduction to views, see topic "**Views overview**". A link to this topic is under **Related concepts** below.

Views are placed in folder "**Deleted Views**" in the topic "**Deleting metadata**". A link to this topic is under **Related tasks** below.

2.  Under **Administration**, click **Empty Deleted Views Folder**.

3.  A window appears named "**Confirm deletion**". Click **OK** to proceed with the delete of views in that folder. Click **Cancel** to avoid any deletes.


The deleted views cannot be recovered. If more views are placed in the folder "**Deleted Views**" then repeat this topic when those views can be permanently deleted.
