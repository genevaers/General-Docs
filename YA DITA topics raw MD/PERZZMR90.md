## 10 Symptoms {#10 .section}

|Symptom|Details of symptom|Possible problems|
|-------|------------------|-----------------|
|No views in output VDP|MR90 output VDP has no views.|MR90 excluded all views|

## 40 Possible problems {#40 .section}

|Problem|Details of problem|Solutions|
|-------|------------------|---------|
|Missing or incorrect PARM options for MR90|Even if the SYSOUT error message says 'too many arguments given", it may be that a required PARM option is missing.Â Alternatively, an incorrect PARM option may be encoded.|Review PARM options|
|MR90 did not correctly exclude views|The input config file for MR90 does not contain the appropriate VIEWID and/or FOLDERID parameters. These parameters must be under the section \[VIEWS TO RUN\], be spelled correctly, and refer to relevant id numbers that are already in the input VDP file.|Review input parameters|
|MR90 excluded all views|MR90 coded some VIEWID and/or FOLDERID parameters in the input config file, and this resulted in no views being selected by MR90. This can occur if the values for these two parameters do not refer to values that are already in the input VDP file.|Review input parameters|
