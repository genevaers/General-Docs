Use this screen to manage database connection names. At least one database connection name must exist to allow login to the SAFR workbench.

A database connection name provides the access to a SAFR Database where the SAFR workbench stores data. There are two types of database connection name: **global** and **local:**

-   A global connection is provided by your system administrator and already exists when you login to the workbench. Only a system administrator can create or delete a global connection. These connections are called "global" because these connections can apply to many or all workbench users.

    If required, you can modify a global connection. If you modify a global connection, the workbench allows you to click the "Default" button that removes your modifications and returns that global connection to the original data.

-   A local connection is a database connection name that you create and modify and is available only to you. Any user can create. delete and modify their own local connections. Local connections are only necessary if you require some special access to a SAFR Database.

As you can see above, a global connection has a "**Default**" button, whereas a local connection has a "**Delete**" button. This shows an important difference between a global and a local connection.

This screen is available for all users of the workbench.

System administrators must read the topic "**Workbench overview**" and read the section on "Virtualization for the workbench". For a link, see under **Related concepts** below.

## 05 Errors {#05 .section}

For errors or messages on this screen, see topic "**SAFR Connection Manager errors**". For a link, see under **Related reference** below.

## 10 Is a connection global or local? {#10 .section}

Select that connection name from the drop down box for "**Connection Name**". If the screen has a "**Default**" button, then this is a **global** connection \(even if the button is grey\). If the screen has a "**Delete**" button, then this is a **local** connection.

It is recommended to include the word "local" in the name of any local connections created. This makes the local connections easy to identify.
