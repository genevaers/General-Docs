# Creating logical files {#WETACrLF .task}

Ensure you know the following:

-   The **environment** for the logical file.
-   The **values required** for a new logical file.

Use this topic to create new logical files. The physical files to be associated must already exist in the SAFR Workbench. The logical records may not exist yet and those associations are setup when the relevant logical records are created or modified.

System and environment administrators can always perform this task. General users can perform this task if the **group selected during login** has the **Create Logical File** right in that environment. See your system administrator if you require more rights.

General users need to be aware of help topic "**What metadata do I want to see?**" A link to that topic is under **Related reference** below.

The following topics are useful introductions:

-   "**Logical Files overview**"
-   "**Logical Records overview**"
-   "**Physical Files overview**"

For links to these topics, see under **Related concepts** below.
