## 20 Programs {#20 .section}

The compile phase is the second phase of PE, and consists of program **MR84** alone.

MR84 reads a VDP XML file to create a VDP file. MR84 also recompiles the logic text in the VDP file, which ensures the integrity of the VDP.

The VDP file is passed to the rest of the Performance Engine in the later phases.

In addition to creating the VDP file, MR84 also recompiles the logic text in the VDP file, which ensures the integrity of the VDP.
