This program is part of the SAFR Performance Engine \(PE\).

## 20 What MR84 does {#20 .section}

Note that VDP = View Definition Parameters.

MR84 reads a VDP XML file to create a VDP file. MR84 also recompiles the logic text in the VDP file, which ensures the integrity of the VDP.

The VDP file is passed to the rest of the Performance Engine.
