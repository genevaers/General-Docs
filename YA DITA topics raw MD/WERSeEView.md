If there are **errors**:

-   A large error icon ![](images/Icon_Error_Large_01.gif) appears to the left of "Edit View".
-   **Hover** over "**N errors detected**" to see all errors in the entire view.
-   If present, **hover** over the small error icon ![](images/Icon_Error_Field_01.gif) to see the error in that field.

If there are **warnings**:

-   A window "**Validations**" lists all the warnings. This means there are no errors, only warning messages.
-   An large warning icon ![](images/Icon_Warning_Large_01.gif) appears to the left of "Edit View".
-   **Hover** over "**N warnings detected**" to see all warnings in the entire view.

If you are attempting to **delete a column** in the "View Editor" tab, a window "**Delete Columns**" appears. Click OK to proceed, otherwise click Cancel.

If there are issues with **dependencies** then this window appears:

-   **Inactive dependencies** - if particular View access a Logical Record or Lookup Path that is inactive. The window lists the inactive items.Â This window **cancels the save** \(there is no choice\).
