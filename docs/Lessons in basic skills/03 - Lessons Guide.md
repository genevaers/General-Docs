# 03 - Lessons Guide

**Lesson A** covers topics <u>A04 to A15</u>.  **Lesson B** covers topics <u>B01 to B12</u> and so on.

The lessons are as follows:

- [Lesson A](A04 - Lesson A - START HERE) - Read a Sales file to create report: **Sales by customer number**.  
  While this report is not useful, this solution teaches beginner aspects of our product.  
  
- [Lesson B](B01 - Lesson B - START HERE) - Modify Lesson A to read a Customer file so report is now: **Sales by Customer name**.
  
- [Lesson C](C01 - Lesson C - START HERE) - Modify Lesson B to run faster.  This is the first speed technique (of many).
  
- **<u>Lesson D</u>** - Modify Lesson C to read a Product file so report is: **Sales by customer name and product name**.  
  
- **<u>Lesson E</u>** - Create a second report: **Sales by product name**.  
  
- **<u>Lesson F</u>** - Run both Lesson D and Lesson E in parallel.  This is another speed technique.
