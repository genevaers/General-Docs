## How do I use COL.nnn in ERL?

**COL.nnn** refers to a column value where **nnn** is the number of that column in the current view (starting at one on the leftmost column).

In ERL you can set the column value in any column in the view using a COL.nnn statement. You can also use COL.nnn in an enquiry, for example "IF (COL.nnn = ? " ).

Note: The **COLUMN** statement refers to the current column, so is not applicable in ERL.
