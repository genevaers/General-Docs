# How do I use ISNOTFOUND? 

The ISNOTFOUND function tests the lookup path to see if a record exists for the target, given the current source record.

ISNOTFOUND returns true if the lookup path is not found for the current source record, and false if the lookup path is found.

You can provide an effective date, and symbols, if required. No target field name is specified as a field is not returned.

ISNOTFOUND can only be used in **Extract Record Filter (ERF)** and **Extract Column Logic (ECL)** text.
