# How do I use IF statements in ERF? 

IF statements can be part of any logic text. An IF statement allows a condition to control if one or more statements are executed.

Even though IF statements are allowed in all logic text, the statements that can be called in an IF statement change depending on the particular logic text.

An IF statement can call another IF statement - this is called "nesting" of IF statements, and is allowed in all logic text.

The syntax details of an IF statement in **Extract Record Filter** are shown below.
