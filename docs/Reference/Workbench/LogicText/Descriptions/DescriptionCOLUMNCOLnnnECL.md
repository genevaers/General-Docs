## How do I use COLUMN & COL.nnn statements in ECL? 

**COLUMN** is always a statement where you set the value of the current column. A COLUMN statement is allowed in **Extract Column Logic**.

**COL.nnn** refers to a column value where nnn is the number of that column in that view \(starting at one on the leftmost column\).

You can **set the value** column in the view using a COL.nnn statement in **Extract Column Logic**. This is the only logic text where COL.nnn is a statement.
