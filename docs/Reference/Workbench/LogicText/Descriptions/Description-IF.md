## How do I use IF statements? 

IF statements can be part of any logic text. An IF statement allows a condition to control the execution of one or more statements.

Even though IF statements are allowed in all logic text, the statements that can be called in an IF statement change depending on the particular logic text.

An IF statement can call another IF statement - this is called "nesting" of IF statements, and is allowed in all logic text.
