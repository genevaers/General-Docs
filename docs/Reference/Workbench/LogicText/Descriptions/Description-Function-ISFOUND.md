# How do I use ISFOUND? 

The ISFOUND function tests the lookup path to see if a record exists for the target, given the current source record.

ISFOUND returns true if the lookup path is found for the current source record, and false if the lookup path is not found.

You can provide an effective date, and symbols, if required. No target field name is specified as a field is not returned.

ISFOUND can only be used in **Extract Record Filter (ERF)** and **Extract Column Logic (ECL)** text.
