# This may already be done
This may have been done in [Stage 5 - Implement solution](../How to Implement/Stage 5 - Implement solution).  
If you have JCL, proceed to [Run PE](B Run PE).

# Create JCL required
There are two easy ways to create your JCL:
1. Use a relevant End-to-End Example that suggests the type of JCL you will need.  See [Stage 5 - Implement solution](../How to Implement/Stage 5 - Implement solution).
2. Copy JCL used for a similar batch stream and modify as required.

Once you have the required JCL, proceed to [Run PE](B Run PE).
