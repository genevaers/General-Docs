# Control Records

## Create Control Record

Only system administrators can perform this task. 

To create a new Control Record:

1. Select **Administration** > **New** > **Control Record** from the menu.  
2. In the **Name** field type a descriptive name.  
Note that this name can be used in report headers and footers using the **&[CompanyName]** function.  
3. Save the view folder **File** > **Save**  

## Associate a View with a Control Record

General users can perform this task if the permissions allow.  

1. Open the view.
2. Select the **View Properties** sub-tab **Extract Phase**.
3. Select the control record from the **Control Record** drop-down list.
4. Save the view folder **File** > **Save**  
   

Once the control record has been associated with a view, that control record can be referenced in JCL and used to set fiscal date overrides.
