## Specify a Group

Only system administrators can create groups, so ensure you are logged into the workbench as a **system administrator**. You can be in any environment.

1. Select **Administration** > **New** > **Group** 
2. In the **Name** field type a descriptive name. Add **Comments** if desired.

Save the group definition **File** > **Save**,  
   or click the Save icon in the Workbench toolbar,  
   or press **Ctrl + s**  
  
When the Group is saved, it is assigned a unique GenevaERS ID. The time stamps show when the file was created, and when it was last updated. 

After the above is complete, the group is ready for immediate use.
