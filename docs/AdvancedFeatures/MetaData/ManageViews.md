# Manage Views

In the workbench views can be grouped together in **View Folders**. To list existing views:  

- Click **View Folders** > **ALL_VIEWS** or,
- Click **View Folders** > *folder-name* in the Navigator pane.

The views in the selected folder are shown in the metadata list at the bottom of the workbench screen.  

For details of how to create view folders, and add views to view folders go to [View Folders](./CreateViewFolder.md)  

When a view is added to a view folder, you will see that view folder listed in the view definition.  
Go to **View Properties** > **General** > **View Folders**
