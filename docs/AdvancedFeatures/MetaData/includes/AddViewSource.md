### Specify view source 

Next specify the view source. You must have already defined the physical files, logical files and logical records definitions for the source you want to specify. Note that this is the same process for Extract-phase only views and summary views.

For information on how to define your own logical record, logical file and physical file definitions look at [Create LR, LF, and PF metatdata](./CreateLRLFPFs.html) in Advanced Features.

1. Toggle to the **View Editor** screen.
2. Select **Edit** > **Add View Source**  
   Alternatively, you can Right Click on **View Sources** then select **Add View Source**
3. In the pop-up window use the drop down arrow to select the **Logical Record**, and the **Logical File** you require. Click **OK**.
