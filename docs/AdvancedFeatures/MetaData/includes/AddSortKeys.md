### Add sort keys

Summary views require at least one sort key, and can have up to 5 sort keys defined. The sort keys are based on view columns. You must define the column first, then assign it as a sort key.

To define a column as a **Sort Key**, 

1. Select the column by clicking the column. 
2. Select **Edit** > **Make Sort Key**
3. The **Sort Keys** cell for the column will be highlighted in yellow and show the sequence number of the sort key. Click the yellow cell and the **Sort Key Properties** frame will open on the right.
4. The **Sort Sequence** can be changed from the default Ascending to Descending here.
5. Save the view **File** > **Save**   

Multiple columns can be assigned as sort keys. The columns do not need to be in order since the numbers within the yellow cells indicate which column will be sorted first, second, third, and so on. The arrows within the yellow box indicate whether the column is sorted in ascending or descending order.

To unassign a column as a sort key,

1. Select the column by clicking the column. 
2. Select **Edit** > **Make Non-Sort Key**
3. The **Sort Keys** cell for the column will be greyed out.
5. Save the view **File** > **Save**
