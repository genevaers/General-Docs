### Activate the View 

The view must be activated before the Performance Engine can process it. Activation invokes the compiler which reports errors and warnings.

To activate the view, use any of these methods: 
- Select  **Action** > **Activate** 
- Press the Activate icon on the View Editor toolbar 
- Press **F5**

When the view is active, save it to preserve this active state. The view is now ready to be run.
