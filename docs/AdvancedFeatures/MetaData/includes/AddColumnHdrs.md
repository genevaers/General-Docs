#### Column headings

The column headings that are used in reports are specified on the **View Editor** tab. For column types Source File Field and Lookup Field, the column heading value defaults to the heading value in the logical record. If there is no heading value in the logical record, the field name is used. You can over type this value as needed. You can split a long column heading over the three heading cells **Heading 1**, **Heading 2** and **Heading 3**.
