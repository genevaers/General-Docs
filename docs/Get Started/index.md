# Get Started

## Overview 
GenevaERS is open source software that
- executes high-volume data analysis very efficiently
- is easy to use, with a graphical interface
  
## Overview of Components
GenevaERS consists of two software components: the PC-based Workbench and the mainframe-based batch process known as the Performance Engine. Developers use the Workbench to build applications that are stored in a metadata repository. These applications are then run by the Performance Engine, which reads data from source files or databases, transforms it, and writes it to output files.
