## Basic Concepts

## Basic Skills

User guide style typically contains several examples that describe typical scenarios from start to finish.
E.g. adding and running a first View, based on the Demo data.

Maybe some version of the Training slides can go here, but they will need to be reviewed and edited as they refer to old components that do not exist anymore.
