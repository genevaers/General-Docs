GenevaERS did it in less than one hour - on the same data on the same computer producing the same results. How is that possible? . Reads from disk are 1000 times slower than calculations. Too many reads waste time. Example: a product file has 1,000 records and a sales file has a million records. A report program reads the product file for each sales transaction. That means the report reads the product file a million times. GenevaERS reads the product file just 1,000 times. GenevaERS is fast because it saves 999,000 reads. You could fix this by rewriting your programs. GenevaERS is free and does the programming for you. A paid version is even faster using special features. Link back to First steps . ",

On those Editor screens where the same letter is underlined in different locations, the combination will jump between those locations on that screen.If the same combination is shared between the menu and an Editor screen, then this combination goes to the Editor screen. To reach the menu, press Alt by itself, release it and then press Alt with the underlined letter.| | |Alt|Jump to the **File** menu.| | |Arrow down|Behavior depends on context.Arrow down has special behavior on these screens: - New/Edit Logical Record screen \\(LR Fields tab\\) - New/Edit View screen \\(View Editor tab\\)On all other workbench screens, the behavior of Arrow down depends on the position of the cursor, as follows: - In a multi-line text field \\(such as Comments for a Control Record\\), Arrow down **jumps to the line below**. If already on the lowest line, then Arrow down has no effect.- In a list of values Arrow down **highlights the next value below**. If the lowest value in the list is highlighted, then Arrow down has no effect.- In other types of fields, Arrow down has no effect.| | |Arrow left|Behavior depends on context.Arrow left has special behavior on these screens: - New/Edit Logical Record screen \\(LR Fields tab\\) - New/Edit View screen \\(View Editor tab\\) On all other workbench screens, the behavior of Arrow left depends on the position of the cursor, as follows: - In a text or numeric field such as a Name field, Arrow left **jumps one character to the left**.

All other components will be deselected when this occurs, so this should be the first action for a complex group of selections.| | |Shift + Tab|Behavior depends on context and is the reverse direction of the jumps given for \"Tab\" lower in this table.For example, in an Editor screen the Tab key jumps to the next field whereas Shift + Tab jumps to the previous field.| | |Spacebar|Behavior depends on context.Spacebar has special behavior on these screens: - New/Edit Logical Record screen \\(LR Fields tab\\) - New/Edit View screen \\(View Editor tab\\)On all other workbench screens, the behavior of Spacebar depends on the position of the cursor, as follows: - In a Name field, Spacebar results in an**underscore character \\(\\_\\)** since spaces are not permitted in names. - In other text fields such as Comments, Spacebar results in a **space character \\( \\)**. - In a checkbox field, Spacebar **toggles between a tick and no tick**. - In other fields such as numeric fields or a list of values, Spacebar has no effect.| | |Tab|Behavior depends on context. The Tab key has special behavior on these screens: - New/Edit Logical Record screen \\(LR Fields tab\\) - New/Edit View screen \\(View Editor tab\\) On all other workbench screens, the Tab key jumps between screen objects, and hence depends on the individual screen. In general, the Tab key jumps between these screen objects: - **The editable fields in the current Editor screen**. For example, if the current Editor screen is Edit Control Record, the Tab key jumps from the Name field to Maximum Extract File Number and then to Comments, First Fiscal Month, Beginning Period and Ending Period. - **Buttons in the current Editor screen**.
