# B01 - Course B - START HERE

The report in Course A was almost useless because the report only has "customer number".  In this solution we access the Customer file so that the report displays "customer name".  The technique used is a "lookup path".  Lookup paths are one of the key speed features of this product.

Course B consists of topics:

- Topic [B02 - Lookup paths](B02 - Lookup paths).  
  We need a feature called "lookup paths".  
- Topic [B03 - Define a lookup path](B03 - Define a lookup path)  
  Define a lookup path for the report in the workbench.
