# A03 - Course Guide

**Course A** covers topics <u>A04 to A15</u>.  **Course B** covers topics <u>B01 to B12</u> and so on.

The courses are as follows:

- [Course A](A04 - Course A - START HERE) - Read a Sales file to create report: **Sales by customer number**.  
  While this report is not useful, this solution teaches beginner aspects of our product.  
  
- [Course B](B01 - Course B - START HERE) - Modify Course A to read a Customer file so report is now: **Sales by Customer name**.
  
- [Course C](C01 - Course C - START HERE) - Modify Course B to run faster.  This is the first speed technique (of many).
  
- **<u>Course D</u>** - Modify Course C to read a Product file so report is: **Sales by customer name and product name**.  
  
- **<u>Course E</u>** - Create a second report: **Sales by product name**.  
  
- **<u>Course F</u>** - Run both Course D and Course E in parallel.  This is another speed technique.
