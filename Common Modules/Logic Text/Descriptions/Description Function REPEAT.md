# How do I use REPEAT? 

If you provide a text string and an integer, then REPEAT can create a string that consists of the given text string with integer repetitions. REPEAT is different from ALL because REPEAT has a fixed number of repetitions, whereas ALL is flexible and compares with fields of different lengths.

REPEAT can only be used in **Extract Record Filter (ERF)** and **Extract Column Assignment (ECA)** logic text.
