**COLUMN** is always a statement where you set the value of the current column. A COLUMN statement is allowed in **Format Column Calculations**.

**COL.nnn** refers to a column value where nnn is the number of that column in that view \(starting at one on the leftmost column\).

COL.nnn can only appear in an **inquiry** \(for example "IF \(COL.nnn = ? " \) in the format phase. In **Format Column Calculations**, the nnn must be a column number between 1 and the current column \(inclusive\).
