# How do I use function ALL? 

If you provide a text string then ALL can check if all of a field value is that text string \(repeated\). ALL is different from REPEAT because REPEAT has a fixed number of repetitions, whereas ALL is flexible and compares with fields of different lengths.
ALL can only be used in **Extract Record Filter** or **Extract Column Assignment** logic text.
